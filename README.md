I'm learning to code and just built my first little project: a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

You can play it with a friend on the same device. Simple, but still proud. ðŸ’ª

I'd love your feedback or tips on how to improve it! Especially on how to improve responsiveness to different screen sizes. I am currently looking into CSS Grid in hope of finding a good solution. ðŸ™Œ
